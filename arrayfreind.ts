//Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a array called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

let freinds=["zayan","shazil","rafid"]
console.log(freinds[0])
console.log(freinds[1])
console.log(freinds[2])

//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message3 to them. The text of each message3 should be the same, but each message3 should be personalized with the person’s name.

let message3 = " you're cordially invited to my brother's wedding"

console.log("hello "+freinds[0]+message3)
console.log("hello "+freinds[1]+message3)
console.log("hello "+freinds[2]+message3)
